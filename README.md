# Monte Carlo simulation of biopolymer chain

Monte Carlo simulation is a computational technique used in various fields, including protein research. Monte Carlo simulations are used to model and study the behavior of proteins in different environments and to understand their folding dynamics and in predicting their interactions with other molecules. 


## Description

 A Python program simulation which can be run using IDE like Pycharm etc. 


### Dependencies

Python libraries-matplotlib for plotting and animation,
works on OS (Windows and Linux)
